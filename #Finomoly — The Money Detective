Finomoly

Ever wonder where your money vanishes? Me too… so I built this.

Finomoly is a fully tested Spring Boot backend that:

Tracks your income and expenses

Shows totals, highest spending, and savings

Detects suspicious spending like your personal financial detective

Sorts expenses neatly by date because chaos is not fun

Fully tested with Postman — every endpoint works, trust me.

Built with: Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and MySQL.

Coming soon: A frontend in just a few days so you can actually see all this magic instead of just sending JSON requests manually.
